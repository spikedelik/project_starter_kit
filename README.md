# Your New Project's Launchpad: Build Amazing Web Experiences, Fast!

Welcome! This special "launchpad" (we call it a boilerplate) is designed to help you create beautiful and interactive web projects without getting bogged down in complicated technical setup. Think of it as a pre-assembled kit with all the best tools already connected and ready to go.

### Why This Launchpad is Your Secret Weapon (and Saves You Days!)

Imagine you want to build a new website or web application. Normally, you'd spend days, even weeks, just figuring out which technologies to use, making sure they all work together, and setting up the basic structure. It's like trying to build a car from scratch before you even start driving!

**This launchpad skips all that.** We've already picked the best "ingredients" and put them together perfectly. This means you can potentially **save 40-80 hours** (that's a full work week or two!) that you would have spent on initial setup, compatibility checks, and troubleshooting. You get to jump straight into bringing your ideas to life!

### What Kind of Projects Can You Build with This?

This launchpad is perfect for:

*   **Interactive Websites**: If you need a website where people click buttons, fill out forms, see things change on screen, or have a dynamic experience.
*   **Online Tools & Dashboards**: Great for creating web-based tools, admin panels, or dashboards that display information and let users interact with it.
*   **Quick Prototypes**: Want to show off an an idea quickly? This gets you a working version in no time.
*   **Stylish Designs**: If you love modern, clean designs, this kit makes it easy to build them.

It might be **more than you need** for:

*   **Simple Information Websites**: If your website is just a few pages of text and pictures that don't change much, a simpler approach might be easier.
*   **Behind-the-Scenes Work**: This kit is all about what people *see* and *click on*. If you're building the "engine" of a website that users don't directly interact with, this isn't the right tool.

## âœ¨ Supercharge Your Setup with AI Tools! (Recommended for Vibe Coders) âœ¨

If you're using an AI-powered coding assistant or IDE (like Cursor, VSCode with Copilot/Cody, or even Gemini CLI), you can make these setup steps incredibly fast! You won't need to open a separate "command window" or type any complex commands yourself. Your AI will handle it all!

Here's how to get started in just **2-3 simple steps**:

1.  **Get the Code into Your AI Tool**:
    *   **Option A (Easiest)**: In your AI-powered IDE, look for an option like "Clone Repository," "Open from GitHub," or "Start New Project from Template." Then, paste the link to this GitHub repository: `https://github.com/spikedelik/project_starter_kit.git`
    *   **Option B (Manual Download)**: If your AI tool doesn't have a direct "clone" option, you can download the files manually:
        1.  On this GitHub page, look for a green button that says `Code`.
        2.  Click on it, and then select `Download ZIP`.
        3.  Once downloaded, unzip the file. You'll get a folder like `your-repo-name-main`. Rename this folder to whatever you want your project to be called (e.g., `my-awesome-website`).
        4.  Now, open this newly renamed folder directly in your AI-powered IDE.

2.  **Tell Your AI What You Want!**:
    Once the project is open in your AI tool, simply give your AI assistant a high-level prompt like this. It will understand and handle everything from installing dependencies to setting up your project's name and getting it running!

    ```
    "I've just opened this boilerplate project. Please set it up for me:
    1. Install all necessary project components.
    2. Change the project name to 'My Awesome New App'.
    3. Update the browser tab title to 'My Awesome New App - Home'.
    4. Start the development server so I can see it in my browser."
    ```
    Your AI assistant will understand these requests and make the necessary changes and start your project automatically, saving you a ton of time!

**That's it!** Your project should now be set up, named, and running in your browser, all thanks to your AI assistant.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started the Traditional Way (No AI IDE?) ðŸš€

No worries if you're not using an AI-powered coding assistant! You can still get this launchpad up and running quickly. You'll just need to use your computer's "command window" (sometimes called Terminal or Command Prompt) for a few steps.

1.  **Get Your Project Files**:

    *   **The Easy Way (Recommended if you know Git)**: If you're familiar with Git (a way to manage project files online), you can "clone" this project to your computer. This makes a perfect copy.
        *   Open your computer's "command window."
        *   Type this command and press Enter:
            ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/spikedelik/project_starter_kit.git your-new-project-name
            ```
            *(Replace `https://github.com/spikedelik/project_starter_kit.git` with the actual link to this GitHub repository, and `your-new-project-name` with what you want to call your project folder.)*
        *   Then, navigate into your new project folder:
            ```bash
            cd your-new-project-name
            ```

    *   **Download Files Manually**: If you prefer not to use Git, you can download all the files directly.
        1.  On this GitHub page, look for a green button that says `Code`.
        2.  Click on it, and then select `Download ZIP`.
        3.  Once downloaded, unzip the file. You'll get a folder like `your-repo-name-main`. Rename this folder to whatever you want your project to be called (e.g., `my-awesome-website`).
        4.  Open your computer's "command window" and go into that new folder.

2.  **Get All the Pieces Ready**:
    Once you're inside your new project folder in the command window, type this and press Enter:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command gathers all the necessary "building blocks" for your project. It might take a minute or two, and you'll see a lot of text scroll by â€“ that's normal!

3.  **See Your Project Live!**:
    After the previous step finishes, type this and press Enter:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start your project on your computer. You'll see a message in your command window telling you a web address (like `http://localhost:5173`). Copy that address and paste it into your web browser (like Chrome or Firefox). **Voila!** You'll see your new project's starting page!

**Congratulations!** You now have a fully working project ready for you to start building your amazing ideas.

## What's Inside This Launchpad? (The Main Ingredients)

This launchpad uses some of the best and most popular technologies to build modern web experiences. Here are the main ones:

*   **React (Version: 19.1.0)**: This is the core "engine" for building interactive parts of your website. It helps you create reusable pieces for your design.
*   **Vite (Version: 5.0.0)**: This is a super-fast tool that helps your project load quickly while you're working on it. No more waiting around!
*   **TypeScript (Version: ~5.8.3)**: This is like a smart assistant that helps prevent mistakes as you build. It makes sure all the pieces of your project fit together correctly.
*   **Tailwind CSS (Version: 4.1.11)**: This helps you style your website beautifully and quickly, without writing a lot of complicated design rules.

### Keeping Your Project Fresh (Important!)

Just like your phone apps need updates, the "ingredients" in this launchpad also get new versions. It's a good idea to:

*   **Check for Updates**: Every few months, you might want to check if newer versions of React, Vite, TypeScript, or Tailwind CSS are available.
*   **Ensure Compatibility**: When you update, sometimes things change. Make sure the new versions still work well together. (Don't worry, there are tools to help with this later on!)

## Making Your Project Your Own (Manual Customizations)

If you're not using an AI-powered assistant to automate these, here's how to manually customize your project:

### 1. Give Your Project a Name

To change the name that appears in your project's settings (like when you install new "building blocks"), you'll edit a file called `package.json`.

*   Open the `package.json` file in your project folder.
*   Look for the line that says `"name": "your-project-name"`.
*   Change `"your-project-name"` to whatever you want your project to be called (e.g., `"my-awesome-website"`).

```json
// package.json (just an example of what to change)
{
  "name": "my-awesome-website", // Change this line to your project's name!
  "private": true,
  // ... rest of the file
}
```

### 2. Change the Browser Tab Title

When someone opens your website, they see a title in their browser tab. To change this:

*   Open the `index.html` file in your project folder.
*   Find the part that looks like `<title>New Project</title>`.
*   Change `New Project` to your desired title (e.g., `My Awesome Website`).

```html
<!-- index.html (just an example of what to change) -->
<head>
  <title>My Awesome Website</title> <!-- Change this line! -->
</head>
```

### 3. Connecting to Online Services (APIs)

If your project needs to talk to other online services (like getting information from a weather app or saving data to a database), you'll use special "address books" called `.env` files.

*   **`.env.development`**: For when you're building the app on your computer.
*   **`.env.staging`**: For a testing version of your app (before it goes live).
*   **`.env.production`**: For your live, public-facing app.

You can add a line like this to the right `.env` file (for example, in `.env.production` for your live service):

```
# .env.production (example of what to add)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.your-online-service.com/
```

### 4. Special Feature: 3D Graphics (Totally Optional!)

This launchpad includes some powerful "building blocks" that let you create amazing interactive 3D graphics right inside your web project. Think of games, product viewers, or cool visual effects!

*   **If you need 3D**: Fantastic! These tools are already installed and ready for you to use.
*   **If you DON'T need 3D**: No problem! You can easily remove these extra pieces to make your project a bit smaller.
    1.  Open your command window in your project folder.
    2.  Type this and press Enter:
        ```bash
        npm uninstall @react-three/drei @react-three/fiber three
        ```
    3.  This won't break anything in the basic setup, as the starting project doesn't use these 3D features.

## Handy Shortcuts (Commands You'll Use)

Here are some quick commands you can type in your project's command window:

*   `npm run dev`: Starts your project so you can see it live in your browser (what you used earlier!).
*   `npm run build`: Gets your project ready to be put online for everyone to see. This creates the final, optimized version.
*   `npm run lint`: Checks your project for common mistakes and helps keep it neat and tidy.
*   `npm run format`: Automatically cleans up the way your project's files are organized and spaced.
*   `npm test`: Runs automated checks to make sure everything in your project is working correctly.

## Where Things Live (A Quick Tour)

Here's a very simple map of your project's main folders:

*   `public/`: This is where you put things like images or special fonts that your website uses directly.
*   `src/`: This is the most important folder! All the main parts of your website live here.
    *   `src/App.tsx`: This is like the main "canvas" where you'll build what your website looks like.
    *   `src/main.tsx`: This is the very first file your project looks at when it starts.
*   `tests/`: This folder holds special files that check if your project is working as it should.
